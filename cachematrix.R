## This pair of functions caches the inverse of a matrix.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse. 
## It contains four small functions to 
## 1. set the value of the vector
## 2. get the value of the vector
## 3. set the value of the mean
## 4. get the value of the mean

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  s <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    s <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setSolve <- function(solve) s <<- solve
  getSolve <- function() s
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setSolve = setSolve,
       getSolve = getSolve)
}


##  This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
##  If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
##  then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  s <- x$getSolve()
  if(!is.null(s)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(s)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  s <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setSolve(s)
  s
}
